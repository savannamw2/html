        Being a college student can be difficult when learning to budget and allocating time properly. School to Kitchen works to remedy some 
        of those problems. Getting into the kitchen to make nutricious meals and drinks to help overcome the need to get fast food. Learning to
        cook in the kitchen with simply recipes and ingredients that won't break the bank (hopefully)! Recipes will be easy and will not 
        require any special techniques. College students will find healthy nutricious meals for themselves and their roommates for a fun meal and 
        with a fun beverage! This will include alternatives to Sodavine drinks, but equal amounts of flavor! This site is tailored for BYU-I 
        students who need help become the cook in the apartment. It is stressful enough to maintain a healthy school-life balance and with themselves
        easy recipes students can enjoy some healthy meals and drinks instead of grabbing a quick bite from Mcdonald's.

      <h3>Meals</h3>
      <p>
        Cheap and quick meals are a great way to not break the bank and have a delicious homemade meal! The recipes will include two
        different price points, individuals will be able to choose what fits their needs but will be equally as tasty! Everyone has 
        different kinds of budgets, and this can help keep a budget for groceries and maybe have 1-3 meals that can be made in the 
        apartment and maybe show off amazing cooking skills to roommates! Having suggestions that are tailored towards a college 
        students budget can ease some of the stress to find things within reasonable pricepoints and do not require 20+ ingredients.

      <h3>Drinks</h3>
      <p>
        A nice beverage during a summer day is worth making! Sure, Sodavine is delightful, but making them is cheaper and more rewarding!
        While beig healthy with less preservatives, they offer many benefits! Whether Dr. Pepper is used or Lemonade, individuals can get
        creative with creamers, syrups, and fruits! There are so many ways to make a fun drink while walking around Porter Park, do 
        homework, or FHE nights! Sparkling lemonades are a delight during hot afternoons and even better when you're saving money!
        Make a drink that is amazing as you!
