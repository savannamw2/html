    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>I have owned Splash Raft for 2 years now, but have relied heavily of word of mouth to get my company out there. 
        With launching this site, I want people to have access to my amazing company where they can rent rafts for white
        water and doit with an easy click of the button! Before, I was running the company with planners and handing cash, 
        but now I can rely rely on the website to tell me the dates, rentals, and revenue that it has generated through 
        the traffic of my site! White Water Rafting has been my favorite hobby for several years and I want people to know 
        that beginner or expert that Splash Raft is the best site to get there needs to start! 
    </p>

    <p>My audience is for those who are 18+ (for safety reasons) who want to start exploring the hobbies outdoors. 
        White water rafing is for those who seek an adrenaline rush and work with a team to experience a thrill of
        a lifetime! It is the perfect weekend activity that will chanllenge and be rewarding for those who try it!
        Cutomers of Splash Raft want to experience the rush they can't get from hiking or climbing. They can find
